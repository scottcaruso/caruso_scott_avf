				<h2>Native Functions</h2>
					<p>There are two distinct components that I'd like to look at it relation to changing the HTML on my Demo app. First and foremost, there's the HTML that already exists. In this regard, I'm using very basic section markup to separate various sections, coupled with nav and ul tags to organize my content. There is also, of course, the html video content that I'm using as well. Creating subtitles - and then including markup for those subtitles - would be a relatively easy first step to take in order to make my demo app more accessible for hard-of-hearing users. Another thing that I'm missing is alt tags on the images I've created for my navigation buttons. Though in the navigations this isn't a huge deal, getting into the practice of adding alt tags to my images can be nothing but a boon to future accessibility. The download link for my .pdf file could also be much better, providing a description of what the .pdf is rather than simply a "download .pdf" description.</p>
 
					<p>The other component to consider is changes that I would make that don't already exist in some form on my page. For instance, I don't offer a text-only version of the site, which is a much safer bet for accessibility for screen readers. I've also never tested to verify that my CSS is compatible with alternate font sizes that vision-impaired folks might use. This is a type of testing that I should certainly look into doing more of in the future.</p>

					<p>Specific to people using screen readers, some of the most common problems seem to be pictures and forms that are not labeled properly (thus confusing the screen reader), links being inaccessible or not loading properly, and issues with the screen reader itself breaking. More "minor" issues included links being labeled in a non-descript way and pop-ups interfering with navigation. An issue I saw only once, but that bears mentioning, is frustration with a website that required mouse navigation and allowed no keyboard input.</o>

					<p>Some of these issues - especially the alt and form tags and screen layouts - are easy to fix by simply taking better care to design websites with these features in mind. An "accessibility checklist" might be a good way to handle this; as a designer/developer, if I have a checklist of requirements to follow to ensure that any page that I build meets accessibility demands, I can be sure to not forgot to keep these key components in mind, As for the layout, if my website doesn't lend itself to being designed in a linear, naturally-flowing manner, perhaps providing a text-only version that distributes the layout in a more reader-friendly manner would be an option.</p>

					<p>One of the most widely-distributed accessibility devices is the on-screen keyboard, with most modern operating systems come with as a standard piece of software. This device is as simple as it sounds - it provides a keyboard directly on the computer screen that can be clicked on with the mouse. Many of these keyboards also feature a "dwell" feature that automatically "clicks" a key when it is hovered over for an amount of time for people who have difficulty with the clicking motion, and others have predictive technology to auto-complete words for users.</p>

					<p>As was discussed in the discussion overview, screen readers are also commonly used by individuals with handicaps - particularly the vision-impaired - to navigate and read information on web-sites. Screen reader features vary across platforms, but Apple's VoiceOver, as an example, offers reading of not just the screen but of keyboard inputs as well. It also offers multi-touch/swipe motion functionality for users on laptops to more easily navigate screen elements.</p>

					<p>On the topic of screen readers, there is an Android screen reader called TalkBalk that attempts to provide additional features to users that need assistance. With audible and contextual (vibration-based) feedback provided when navigating the Android OS, the reader attempts to make Andorid applications more accessible than ever before.</p>

					<p>A more unique accessibility application I found is called openWeb for iOS, which is billed as a "dyslexia friendly web browser." It uses an open-source font called "OpenDyslexic", which is intended to be especially easy to read for dyslexic readers. It also includes lower-contrast colors and bolder symbols to help break up sentences. Though I had never really considered the needs of dyslexic users before, content-rich websites should certainly keep them in mind when designing the styles for those sites.</p>
