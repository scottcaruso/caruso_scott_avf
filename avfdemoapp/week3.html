				<h2>Market Research</h2>
					<h4>What are the top-selling app categories in the U.S.? In Great Britain? In Japan?</h4>
 
					<p>Not surprisingly (to me, anyways), the consumption habits of users in the United States and in Great Britain are very similar. The top-selling and top-grossing applications – both recently and of all-time – are almost exclusively gaming applications. In fact, there is quite a bit of crossover between the two lists as well.</p>
					 
					<p>On the iOS platform, games like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope are perennial favorites, and though there is some variance in the lists (a 17+ survival game, for instance, appears at the top of the iPhone U.K. list for August), nearly every single top-selling and top-grossing application in both the U.S. and the U.K. is some form of puzzle/strategy game that can be taken in bite-sized chunks.</p>
					 
					<p>A similar consumption pattern is seen in the Android Market, with recent top-lists being populated with games such as Draw Something, Minecraft, and Asphalt Heat. Interestingly, when looking at the top paid Android apps of all-time, you’ll find a number of productivity apps (for instance, a different on-screen keyboard and an application that adds widgets/new home screen features); this speaks more to the open-nature of the Android platform, which expectedly allows for some level of customization and experimentation by its user-base. As expected, these productivity apps are popular across both the U.S. and U.K.</p>
					 
					<p>What was most interesting to me was how different the Japanese consumption patterns are compared to the Western countries. Though I don’t mean to imply that I expected users in Japan to enjoy and spend money on the same things that U.S. and U.K. audiences would, but I was surprised to learn what Apple reports are the top-selling and top-grossing applications in Japan and how that differs with what external sites are reporting as the top applications in Japan.</p>
					 
					<p>Starting with iOS (where, as previously noted, the top applications were almost exclusively games), Apple reports that of the top 10 best-selling Japanese applications of all-time, only 5 of those are games. The others are productivity-based or eReaders. In their list of the most recent top sellers, Apple reports 3 readers, a camera app, and a productivity app as the top-sellers of late.</p>
					 
					<p>Interestingly, on Android it appears as if the top applications of late ARE games applications. Xyologic reports that there are 3 card/puzzle games among the August top 5, along with a portable version of Minecraft and an emulator for playing old Super Nintendo games. All-time, it seems as if Japanese consumption patterns mirror their iOS habits, with eReaders and productivity applications leading the way.</p>
					 
					<h4>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</h4>
					 
					<p>A good friend of mine, Shari Bryant, is an expert in Japanese culture and, in fact, has been living in Japan, so I specifically asked her about why she felt the consumption habits were different. At first, I thought that it had something to do with a Gamasutra article I read a few years ago about how, amongst older citizens, gaming was still seen as a taboo, something that you stopped doing when you became an adult. She told me that she doesn’t see the “taboo” being nearly as strong as it used to be, saying “I definitely don’t see gaming as a taboo now like it was even a few years ago.”</p>
					 
					<p>When I pressed her about these sales statistics I had uncovered, she quickly responded, “Perhaps it’s the way gaming devices are defined in Japan. In America, we definitely value the idea of an all-in-one machine for our talk, email, gaming, etc. It’s viewed differently in Japan, so when someone buys a tablet, it’s not seen as a strong candidate for gaming.”</p>
					 
					<p>This, then, makes sense to me; if the tablet and phone have been defined in Japanese culture as mobile web browsers, or eReaders, or work productivity devices, it would be much more unlikely for the “killer apps” to be games. My friend noted that she sees Nintendo DS and PSP devices all over the city when she is traveling; so mobile gaming is definitely alive and well in the country. The devices we are working with, however, serve a different purpose in the nation.</p>
					 
					<p>That’s not to ignore the U.S. and U.K. markets, however. If you look at the top OVERALL charts for both kinds of devices, you see a number of native and non-native free applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, Mail, etc. Clearly, people are using these devices for a variety of purposes. What it tells me, however, is that though we’re not willing to pay for experiences that we could otherwise get somewhere else (for instance, Facebook via the web), we are more than happy to shell out money for entertainment-related diversions (this also explains why people are so willing to pay $13 to go to the movies!). The key, of course, is to design a fun, engaging experience that people are willing to pay for.</p>
					 
					<h4>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S.? In Japan? In Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</h4>
					 
					<p>Overall, according to the Android Developer site, only 25% of users are on some version of SDK 4.0, with only 2% using OS 4.1 Jellybean. As best as I can tell, there is no statistically significant difference in adoption rates among different countries. The key point is that over half of Android users are still on OS 2.3 (Gingerbread), which is many iterations old at this point.</p>
					 
					<p>In a literal sense, there are a number of native OS features that the developer cannot take advantage of with such a large install base still using such old software, and he must weigh the benefits of designing something really cool for early-adopters (who, by proxy, will want to spend money on cool new toys for their device) with the reality of needing to appeal to a majority of customers that are still on older devices. The biggest development process change that needs to be taken into account is a significant time investment in both design and testing to ensure that an application is backwards functional even if it utilizes features that only 2% of the population can access. Though it would be awesome, for instance, to be able to use 4.1’s improved memory management and live wallpapers, extensive testing has to be done on early versions to ensure compatibility and user-experience on older devices.</p>
					 
					<h4>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How does this impact development?</h4>
					 
					<p>At least 75% of Japanese mobile users have all-you-can-eat unlimited data plans, so bandwidth considerations aren’t nearly as worrisome in that country as they are in the United States and United Kingdom, where the most common plans are for 5GB per month. In the U.S., these plans commonly run around $50 per month, while in the U.K. they cost 25 Euros (which is about $32 US).</p>
					 
					<p>Interestingly, this is actually more than enough for most users; studies have shown that in the U.S. and U.K, only slightly more than 1 GB per month are being used by most users, and though it is in a developer’s best interests to design applications to rely less on large amounts of bandwidth, the reality is that most users are using far less data than the most common plans offer. Even “throttling” plans that have been in and out of the news in recent months (which are already in place for many providers in Japan, who throttle users who average 366 MB/day usage over 3 straight days) impact a small fraction of the population.</p>
					 
					<p>That’s not to say that a developer should cavalierly use as many network resources as possible (daily data usage has skyrocketed in the past year, to the point that many experts expect that the monthly usage will triple or more in the next 3 years), a developer shouldn’t yet be concerned with sacrificing quality because of a concern of slightly more data usage. The data usage concerns should, instead, come down to performance; does excessive data usage impact performance in the application? Is there data that can be safely stored locally to help improve this performance?</p>
					 
					<p>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</p>
					 
					<p>One statistic that hasn’t been covered yet, but definitely bears mention, is that even though smartphone/tablet/mobile penetration in Japan is as high as 95%, there are still more mobile users in the United States in terms of raw numbers than in Japan and England combined. For that reason alone, any strategy that starts with the United States can’t be faulted for that; all other things equal, a developer has a better chance of reaching a wider audience within the United States than in either of the other two nations. That doesn’t mean that there’s no money to be made in Japan and England, but only that the United States can be a “safe bet” for moneymakers.</p>
					 
					<p>Gaming applications are regularly the top grossing on both platforms. Though the markets are saturated with new entries, there is definitely an audience willing to consume that type of media across all locales (with a caution thrown up for iOS devices in Japan, as previously noted).</p>
					 
					<p>If building the next Angry Birds were that easy, everyone would be doing it, but there is a cross-continental appeal for easy-to-use, pick-up-and-play gaming experiences like that. Strategic puzzle games have a broad appeal and are making lots of money right now, so I would certainly recommend that niche to anyone looking to break into the market.</p>
